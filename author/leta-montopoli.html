                <a href="http://lmontopo.github.io/interviews.html"><h3 class="article-title">Interviews are oportunities to learn</h3></a>
<h6 class="subheader" title="2015-01-29T05:00:00-05:00">Thu 29 January 2015
</h6>


<p>Over the past month I've had my first experience interviewing for development positions.  Its been a somewhat nerve-racking experience but also, at times, enjoyable.  I've come to realize that the best way to approach an interview is with an attitude of excitement and an openness to learn.</p>
<p>A couple days before my first 'technical' interview I was feeling pretty overwhelemed.  Tom, a Hacker School facilitator, reminded me that <strong>its public knowledge that I haven't been programming forever</strong>.  He continued to explain that its OK I don't know everything, and that I'm not expected to.  This was exactly the reminder I needed to hear. Of <em>course</em> I don't know everything.  I'm just starting out in this field!  Sonali suggested I have fun with my interviews and that I view them as opportunities to learn.  </p>
<p>Their words of wisdom have really helped me make the most of my interviews. When I stopped putting pressure on myself to be something I'm not (an experienced programmer who knows everything) I could relax, be open to learning, and be genuinely engaged in conversations about programming.  Regardless of whether or not they lead to a job, I am counting my interviews thus far to be a success because of the way I handled them.  I was genuine, I had fun, and I learned cool things.  Win.</p>
<p>On that note, here's a neat Python thing I learned during a recent technical interview<sup id="fnref:*"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:*" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: </p>
<h4>A Python Function's Default Arguments Are Mutable:</h4>
<p>Without running the python code, guess what the following lines would return in an interactive Python interpreter.  (Actually try to guess them before reading my answer! I've added a blank line where you should be guessing):</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre> 1

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">c</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Have you guessed yet?!
... </p>
<p>My guess was <code>[1]</code>, <code>[1]</code>, <code>[1,1]</code> but the correct answer is <code>[1]</code>, <code>[1,1]</code>, <code>[1,1,1]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>What does all of this mean and what does it tell us about the way Python handles default arguments?</strong></p>
<p>It means that the default argument binding<sup id="fnref:%"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:%" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> happens at the function's <em>definition</em> not at the function's <em>execution</em>.  In other words, the statement <code>a = []</code> is evaluated when the function definition statement is executed, but not when the function is called and its body is executed.</p>
<p>Lets dig a little deeper.  Recall that in Python everything, including functions, is an object. When a function definition is executed a new function object is created.  This function object will have an attribute called <code>func_defaults</code> that contains the values of the default arguments.  </p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">func_defaults</span>
<span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],)</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Like usual object attributes, func_defaults can be mutated.  In our example, the default argument is mutated when the body of the function is executed. Since the line of code that sets func_defaults to <code>[]</code> is run only when the object is instantiated, these mutations affect the default value for subsequent calls on the function. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense!  Feel free to ask questions if it doesn't. :) Also, some useful resources can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1132941/least-astonishment-in-python-the-mutable-default-argument">here</a> and <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm">here</a>.  </p>
<p>And to anyone out there currently undergoing interviews: Try to have fun.  Above all else, be yourself.  You are already impressive.</p>
