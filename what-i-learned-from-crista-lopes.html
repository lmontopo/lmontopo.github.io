    <p>The resident at Hacker School during my first week was Crista Lopes. She
has given some great</p>
<p>lectures, and she's taught me some cool things!</p>
<h5>Different Styles of Writing Code</h5>
<p>On Monday night she spoke to us about coding styles, the topic of her
latest book. Crista explained</p>
<p>that there are many different styles of code to work with, but that
often programmers get stuck in</p>
<p>one way of coding. No style is "better" than another, but some work
better in certain situations.</p>
<p>Crista suggests that when we set out to write a program we ask
ourselves, "what are</p>
<p>our constraints?". Our constraint could be something we need to
minimize/avoid, or something</p>
<p>we want to maximize/include. Examples of constraints include minimizing
the number of lines</p>
<p>in our code, including functions, not including functions, and
maximizing efficiency. Theses</p>
<p>constraints produce different "styles" of code. As a programmer, it is
good to familiarize</p>
<p>ourselves with these different styles so that we can write in whichever
style is best suited for a</p>
<p>particular project.</p>
<h5>Data Types and Data Structures</h5>
<p>On Wednesday Crista gave a really helpful introductory lecture on data
types and data structures.  </p>
<p>Before this lecture I had little knowledge on the subject. I had heard
the words before but not</p>
<p>really understood their meanings. Here is how she explained the two
concepts:</p>
<p>A <strong>data type</strong> is something more conceptual. It refers to our ideas of
what can be done with</p>
<p>the data and what we want to do with the data.</p>
<p>The term <strong>data structure</strong>, on the other hand, refers to how we
<em>implement</em> the data type. When we talk</p>
<p>about data structure we are referring to how a "data type" is actually
storred in memory on our</p>
<p>computer and how we can access that data.</p>
<p>Crista talked about two common implementations of data in our computer:
the array, and the</p>
<p>list. An array is a continuous portion of memory in our computer with
slots to put our data</p>
<p>in. Each slot takes up the same amount of memory, and the total amount
of memory is fixed. Any</p>
<p>slot of the array can be accessed directly. A list, on the other hand,
is NOT continuous. Different</p>
<p>elements of the list can be stored in any location on the computer's
harddrive. Your computer</p>
<p>knows which item is first in the list and each item will point to the
location in memory where</p>
<p>the next item on the list is located.</p>
<p><em>Ok... but why does all of this matter?!</em> Well, Crista provided us with
an example to illustrate why</p>
<p>these things are important: Suppose we have a list of 500 contacts on
our computer. Our list</p>
<p>contains the names and telephone numbers of each contact. We can call
this data type a</p>
<p>"contact list". We have some choices as to how we can implement this
data. One option would be</p>
<p>to use the list implementation described above. In this case, to find a
contact's telephone number</p>
<p>we must scan through the list, starting from the top, until we arrive at
the name we are looking for.  </p>
<p>Another option would be to implement our contact list as a hash
function.</p>
<p><em>What is a hash function?!</em></p>
<p>I think the best way to illustrate the hash function is by example, the
way Crista described it.</p>
<p>In our contact list scenario, an example of a hash function would be
something that acts as follows:</p>
<p>For each contact, the computer associates to it the number of letters in
that contact's first name.</p>
<p>Then an array, lets call it a, is created in memory. The nth cell of a
will "point" to a new list,</p>
<p>containing only the contacts whose names have n letters. From there the
search starts from the top</p>
<p>down, but the list is (hopefully) much smaller in size. Using this hash
function is much more</p>
<p>efficient than just creating one list containing all of the contacts.
Indeed, computers can</p>
<p>compute simple mathematical calculations like this one extremely
quickly, while scanning through</p>
<p>lists is a more time consuming task.</p>
<p>At this point, I'd like like to clarify something about data structures
and types: What certain</p>
<p>programming languages refer to as "lists" and "arrays" are not
necessarily implemented as such.</p>
<p>Likewise, what is implemented as a list or array or hash function in a
programming language is not necessarily</p>
<p>called a list, array or hash function. I know that this is kind of
confusing, but here are some examples</p>
<p>to clarify the situation. What Python calls a "list" of n elements is
actually implemented as an array</p>
<p>with more than n slots. The array is created longer than necessary,
leaving several slots empty.</p>
<p>This makes the array easier to append (ie. add elements to). Another
example in Python is the</p>
<p>data type "dictionary", which is actually implemented as a hash
function.</p>
<h5>Objects, Functions, Etc.</h5>
<p>On Thursday, I came to Crista with a few questions about some
terminology that had been confusing</p>
<p>me. I didn't really understand what was meant by the terms "functional
programming" and "object</p>
<p>oriented programming". I wondered, "are these terms referring to
particular languages or</p>
<p>are they referring to a style of writing code"? According to Crista,
these terms mostly apply to the</p>
<p>style a program is written in. However, the terms are sometimes used to
describe languages.  </p>
<p>(No wonder I was confused!) Crista explains that when you step far
enough away, you can see certain trends in programming languages too.
Some languages</p>
<p>might tend towards the functional style, while others might tend towards
the object oriented style,</p>
<p>for example. In reality, though, most languages pull from all different
ideas. Python is an</p>
<p>example of this. Although Python is often called "object oriented",
Python also has functions!</p>
<p>Most languages combine these ideas as does Python, though there are some
exceptions. Haskel,</p>
<p>for example, is a purely functional programming language.</p>
<p>This leads me to the next question:</p>
<p>What is an object and why is it important? Although I've created classes
and objects in</p>
<p>Python programs, I wasn't sure I really understood the point. Crista
provided me with an</p>
<p>explanation that I liked. She explained how objects are constructs which
"wrap around"</p>
<p>your data, so that you can't access it directly. This protects the data
so that it is less</p>
<p>likely to be accidentally corrupted. There are other ways that data can
be protected if a</p>
<p>language doesn't use classes, but this is just one of those ways.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks Crista for visting Hacker School this week!!!!</strong></p>
