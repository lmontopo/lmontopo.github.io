<p>Hello again, Internet People!  Lets start with some news and updates!</p>
<h3>Hacker School is now The Recurse Center</h3>
<p>This is kind of 'old' news, but since I went AWOL for a while, I'm only now making the announcement to the world.  For now, I am going to leave my old blog posts that mention Hacker School as is, but in the future I hope to go back and change them.  Going forward, I will use 'The Recurse Center' exclusively.</p>
<p>For anyone who would like more information about The Recurse Center or about the name change, check out these links: </p>

<li><a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center">www.recurse.com/blog/77-hacker-school-is-now-the-recurse-center</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>I'm working at Security Compass</h3>
<p>After a few months of job searching this winter, I landed a position as a paid intern at a <a href="http://securitycompass.com/">Security Compass</a> in Toronto.  I am a little over 3 months into the position, and I have signed a contract to become a permanent Junior Dev starting in August! I am excited to be staying with them, and I look forward to the challenges to come! </p>
<p>I want to take a quick moment here to thank The Recurse Center for all of the support it offered me during the job search process.  I found much support and advice from the facilitators as well as from other recurse center participants, and for that I am really grateful.  Thank you.  </p>
<h3>Building Momentum</h3>
<p>The move and the internship have been the primary reasons for my blogging leave of absence.  Initially, with all these changes in my life, I needed more rest than usual and so I took a break from blogging.  But then as time passed I found it was increasingly harder to get back into writing.  Despite the <em>plethora</em> of articles I had buzzing in my head demanding to be written, procrastination always seemed to win.  And in the rare moments when I actually managed to write something, I often couldn't find the time to 'perfect' my work and so perfectionism silenced me from publishing it.</p>
<p>This blog post is my attempt to battle perfectionism and procrastination.  I hope that with this imperfect blog post, I can get the ball rolling again, and build the momentum to start writting on a somewhat more regular basis again.  </p>
<p>Ciao!</p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="http://lmontopo.github.io/category/blog.html">Blog</a>
