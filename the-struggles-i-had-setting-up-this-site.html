    <p>For me, setting up my blog was not easy. I think part of this was that I
was impatient,</p>
<p>and part of this was because IT IS HARD! I ran into many weird error
messages and I began</p>
<p>to get quite impatient and frustrated. Thankfully I got Allison to help
me, and together we</p>
<p>figured out what was going on and got things up and running. Here I will
explain what went wrong for me and</p>
<p>how I fixed it. If you encounter similar difficulties, hopefully this
article will help you.</p>
<p>The main struggle I encountered began when I tried to publish my page
through Github.</p>
<p>There are two different ways one can go about doing this: either as a
project page, or</p>
<p>as a user page. Without knowing there was another option, I began
creating my blog as a</p>
<p>Github project page. In order to do this, I had to create a repository
on Github, and then</p>
<p>create branch of the repository called "gh-pages". "gh-pages" is where I
needed to push</p>
<p>the pelican created "output" folder containing all the necessary html to
create the page.</p>
<p>To make this push happen, I made use of the "gh-import" package which
can be installed using pip.</p>
<p>Here is what needed to be done next:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ghp</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">output</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
<span class="n">igin</span> <span class="n">gh</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">pages</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Here, the first line commits changes made in my output folder to the
gh-branch of my LOCAL</p>
<p>repository. (Local meaning, the repository on my own computer, not the
one store on Github.)</p>
<p>The second line of this code pushes these changes to the remote
repository's gh-pages branch</p>
<p>(ie. the branch of the repository stored on github).Then, in about ten
minutes time, my website</p>
<p>was created with url https:://lmontopo.github.io/blog. (here, lmontopo
is my username on github,</p>
<p>and blog was the repository I created).</p>
<p>I wish this were the end of the story, but unfortunately it is not. What
I realized when my</p>
<p>webpage was published is that none of pelican's styling information was
being</p>
<p>received. My webpage was just a simple plain text webpage and it looked
extremely ugly.</p>
<p>What was puzzling was that when I viewed the page source I saw a line in
the code specifying</p>
<p>the location of the style sheet as:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;/th</span>
<span class="n">eme</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">css</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">css</span><span class="s">&quot; /&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But when I clicked on this href, it couldn't find the file. Then I
looked in my github</p>
<p>repository, and searched for that stylesheet file. I found it. It was
there. So why couldn't my</p>
<p>computer find it? Well, it turns out that my computer was looking at the
wrong url. It expected my</p>
<p>css style sheet to be found at "username.github.io/theme/css/main.css",
but in reality it</p>
<p>was located at "username.github.io/repositoryname/theme/css/main.css".</p>
<p>So, at this point I found out that there was such thing as a github user
page,</p>
<p>and I decided to change my page to be one of those instead. I should
clarify that this</p>
<p>was not necessary, and this was not the only way to solve my problem!
Had I decided to</p>
<p>stay with the gh-pages website, I would have needed to change my default
root directory.</p>
<p>This probably is quite easy, although to be honest I don't know exactly
how it is done.</p>
<p>Since I decided to change to a user github page, this is how I
proceeded:</p>
<p>I needed to create a new repository called username.github.io. To
github, this is a magic</p>
<p>repository name. Github will know that you are publishing a user webpage
from the contents</p>
<p>of this repository and it will do the work for you (just as gh-pages was
a magical branch name</p>
<p>for the project pages site.) Then I deleted my old repository. Now, I
needed to tell my computer</p>
<p>to connect remotely with this new repository as opposed to the old one.
(Just because the old</p>
<p>repository is deleted, doesn't mean my computer won't try to find it.)
To do this I type in:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">remote</span> <span class="n">rm</span> <span class="n">origin</span> <span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">rem</span>
<span class="n">ote</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="n">username</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">io</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">g</span>
<span class="n">ithub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">github</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">i</span>
<span class="n">o</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The first line here removes the connection I had to the previous (now
deleted) repository on Github.</p>
<p>The second line adds a remote connection to the repository named
username.github.io found at</p>
<p>https://github.com/username/username.github.io.</p>
<p>Great, now all I had to do was push the contents of my local repository
to the main branch of</p>
<p>my new remote repository as follows:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ghp</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">output</span><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="ow">or</span>
<span class="n">igin</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">gh</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">pages</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">master</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This created a lovely new webpage for me! Notice, though, that here I
had to FORCE the push.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, I am not clear on why this is happening. For now, I have
decided to create</p>
<p>a new local branch called "writing" and I will use this for all of my
version control. This way</p>
<p>I can continue to force push without worrying about anything being lost.
This may not be the</p>
<p>most sophisticated way of handling things, but being quite new to git, I
am more than satisfied</p>
<p>with this solution.</p>
<p>Another little glitch that occurred along the way, and how I solved it:</p>
<p>In the process of playing around with my computer, I somehow deleted the
pelicanconf.py</p>
<p>file that pelican creates for you when you quickstart. This is the file
that specifies all</p>
<p>of your settings. Since it was gone, I had lost my title, and the
default title "A Pelican</p>
<p>Blog" appeared. Obviously, this wasn't desirable. This ended up being a
really easy fix</p>
<p>because all I needed was to re-create this file and save it the
directory where my "content"</p>
<p>folder is found. Then it integrates itself (somewhat magically) into the
html files. Just</p>
<p>make sure that you have the correct formatting, as specified on
pelican's documentation</p>
