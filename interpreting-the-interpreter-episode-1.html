    <p>This episode is all about the experience I had in the initial phases of writing a Lisp interpreter.
I will describe how I started, my thought processes as I progressed, some of the code I wrote, how it worked, and, why, 
at day 3, I decided to start from scratch (almost).  If you are only interested in the final product, 
skip this episode!  If, however, you'd like to get some insight as to how a newbie handled the 
task of writing an interpreter, read on!  </p>
<p>Step one: recruit a friend. (This just makes the process a little more fun, plus its great to have someone to bounce ideas off of!) 
I recruited Kuan.  We decided that we'd each write our own interpreter, but that we'd talk through all the steps
together, work side by side, and help each other debug.  Our plan has worked out great so far!  To start, and we grabbed our computers, 
retreated to a quiet room, and sat quietly for a few moments, contemplating the task at hand. I 
found myself asking, "What do interpreters do again?", and then answering my own question with, "Right, they 'interpret'
and then execute the code".  We figured that before our computers could execute any code, the code
must first be separating into small elements, or <strong>tokens</strong>. (The word <strong>token</strong> is the technical name referring to the smallest element of any 
programming language.)  In separating the code this way, we would later be able to instruct our computers to 
scan through these elements in order, making sense of each element individually, before executing the expressions 
they form together. We figured a good way to go about <strong>tokenizing</strong> would be to create a list of all of the 
tokens in the input.  (Tokenizing is just the action of separating the tokens.  Don't worry if you aren't familiar with the terms token and tokenization.  I didn't 
know the meaning of these words until after I had already tokenized my input!)  This is the code Kuan and I came up with: </p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">holder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&#39;(&#39;</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39; ( &#39;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">holder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">holder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s">&#39;)&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39; ) &#39;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">holder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">holder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39; &#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">holder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">holder</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">holder</span>    
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Here, 'holder' is what I decided to call the list that is constructed from the input, because it 
'holds' the input. Given, for example, </p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;(/ (+ 3  2) (- 4 2))&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>this program will return the list: </p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">holder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;(&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;(&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;+&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;3&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;)&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;(&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;4&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;)&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;)&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Notice that before splitting the input, we added space around each of the brackets.  This accounts for 
the case where the user inputs two brackets side by side, or a number right beside a bracket
with no space.</p>
<p>Having successfully created a list, holder, to hold the contents of our input, 
we begun writing an algorithm to evaluate this content.  For starters, Kuan 
and I decided we would limit ourselves to making our interpreter work for basic math expressions.  After that
we would gradually worry about interpreting more complicated inputs.</p>
<p>When basic math is inputed the most nested expression should be calculated first.  We needed a way 
for the computer to find which math expression is the innermost one.  We created the following 
algorithm: 1- Scan through the elements of holder from left to right in search of the first ')'.
2 - Begin scanning again, this time in search of the last '(' we hit before the first ')'.<br />
3- Extract whatever is inside of those brackets, and evaluate it.  4- In holder, replace this 
innermost expression (including the brackets surrounding it) by its result we just evaluated.<br />
5- Start again at 1.  This process would continue until there were no more brackets and expressions
left to evaluate.  At this point, we would have evaluated the entire expression. </p>
<p>We were able to write a working piece of code that implemented this algorithm, but it was sloppy 
and we'd only interpreted basic math.  Kuan and I took a step back and looked at how our algorithm would pan out moving forward. We brainstormed 
how we could go about interpreting 'define' expressions and we realized our current algorithm was going to get 
pretty complicated.  Consider, for example, interpreting the expression: '(define (func) (+ x 2))'.
If our current algorithm encountered this as input, it would find '(func)' and would get stuck trying to evaluate it.<br />
It seemed that before even beginning our algorithm, we'd have to first scan the entire input looking for the key word 'define'.  Then, every time we find 'define', 
we'd have to find the set of brackets containing the entire 'define' expression.  This in itself is kind of cumbersome, but
we're only the beginning.  Once our entire 'define' expression is isolated, we'd have to search within this expression to
find the our function's name.  This would be done by scanning from left to right and searching for
the first ')' we come across, and then scanning again until we found its corresponding '('.  Then we'd have 
to remember the contents of these brackets, and begin scanning again to find the defined 
function's expression.  Once the expression was found, we'd have to assign the contents of the previous two brackets
as the name of the function's expression we just found.  </p>
<p>If you're getting confused, I don't blame you.  Clearly this algorithm is confusing.  The reason 
it is confusing is  because there are so many states the the computer is required to keep track of 
at any moment.  First we have to know we have found an expression containing 'define', and that we are searching 
for the entire define expression.  Then we isolate this expression, and we have to remember that we are within the define expression 
and that we are searching for the right bracket that will contain the function's name.  Then we have to remember we have found 
the right bracket of the name of the function we are defining, and we're searching for the left bracket containing
the name, etc etc.  SO MUCH TO KEEP TRACK OF!!! </p>
<p>We turned to some resources online to see how they were approaching these things.  We found 
<a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/21-little-lisp-interpreter">Mary Cook's article</a> and <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">Peter Norvig's article</a> helpful. 
They had taken the parsing stage one step further than we 
did.  Instead of storing the brackets as elements of the list, they created a version of "holder" 
which was a nested list.  So, in the example where "(define (func) (x + 2))" is inputed, their code 
would turn it into the following array: </p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;define&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;func&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;+&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;x&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Kuan and I decided to figure out if/how this extra parsing step was advantageous.  After talking 
to Mary Cook in person about it (thanks Mary!) we got our answer: 
Using the nested method allowed us to not have to keep track of as many sates!  Indeed, at each stage 
of interpreting, we could simply look at the outermost list, look at the operator, and then act accordingly.
If we encountered a 'define' expression we could handle it as follows: Given the new structure of
holder we know that if our operator is define then holder[1] will be the function's name.  Likewise, 
we would know that the expression of this defined function could be found at holder[2]. With this 
extra parsing step, there is no longer the need to scan through the list searching for brackets, 
and keeping track of where we are. The nested structure of holder replicates the actual structure of the input, 
and a lot of the pain and agony in our previous method is taken care of for us here. </p>
<p>Having clearly understood the differences between our algorithm and the popular one found online,
and having seen the benefits of theirs over ours, we decided scratch what we had and start again.  (Of course, 
the little tokenizer I described above could stay.) </p>
<p>I would like to mention that I am HAPPY for the mistakes I made, as they resulted in a great deal of 
learning.  I am a big advocate of trying things your own way first, and only changing your way once 
you've learned the merits of another way.  Doing so results in a great deal of learning you 
might otherwise miss out on. </p>
<p>In the next episode, I hope to introduce to you the final product, and explain how it works! 
Stay tuned! </p>
