                <a href="http://lmontopo.github.io/frontend-backend.html"><h3 class="article-title">What's frontend, what's backend?</h3></a>
<h6 class="subheader" title="2016-11-06T05:00:00-05:00">Sun 06 November 2016
</h6>


<p>Last week a co-worker of mine asked me to clarify for him what the difference was between backend and frontend web development.  I had been asked this quesiton before, but this was the first time I felt I provided a clear explanation and was able to instill knowledge.</p>
<p>So, here, I'd like jot down a lof of the key points which I think helped to clarify the meaning of and the difference between 'frontend' and 'backend' development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backend code is run on the server computer while frontend code is run on the client computer.</strong>  </li>
<li>Being a <em>fullstack developer</em> means that you write (or can write) both backend and frontend code. </li>
<li>The backend takes care of any logic that the server needs to run before a response can be sent to the client.  This includes things like retreiving data from a database, authenticating a user or making some calculations.</li>
<li>The frontend code takes care of any logic that needs to run locally - on the clients computer - in response to user interactions.  This includes any subsequent network calls for updated data.</li>
<li>Frontend code is usually written in JavaScript, which your browser can interpret.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why can't I write frontend in Python (or can I)?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Just like all browsers know how to turn HTML and CSS into pretty pages, all browsers know how to 
interpret JavaScript;  <strong>All browsers have built in JavaScript interpreters.</strong> <ul>
<li>Check it out!  In Chrome right click on a page and click on the 'inspect'.  Then click on the 'console' tab.  You are now looking at a JavaScript Interpreter!  For fun, write the following: <code>alert('Leta is cool')</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Python interpreters aren't currently built into browsers.  It's not that they <em>couldn't be</em> it's just that they <em>aren't</em>.  If I wanted to write frontend logic in Python I'd have two choices: <ol>
<li>Write a browser plugin to be able to interpret Python, and prompt users to install it to view my web app. <em>(This type of thing has been done in order to run Java on the frontend! Remember those annoying Java plugin installation promps?)</em></li>
<li>Compile my Python code down to JavaScript before sending it to the client.  This is a bit of a hack, though, because technically javaScript is still what would be running on the client side.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where do HTML and CSS fit in?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Often HTML and CSS are considered frontend.  The reason being is that, like JavaScript, they are interpreted by your browser.</li>
<li>I consider HTML to be backend only in the context of a template that will be compiled by a template enginge.  In this case one is writting an HTML page with added template language logic which will render more HTML depending on the data that is fed into it. </li>
<li>To me, this falls under the backend umbrella because the templatign engine will turn this template into a finished HTML file on the surver side before sending the final HTML file to the client.</li>
<li>Some people agree with me on this distinction, others disagree (and that's OK!)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Further readings</h4>
<p>If you're curious to know a little more, specifically about why / how JavaScript became the only language built into browsers, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3frml2/why_is_javascript_the_only_frontend_programming/?st=iv70e8ah&amp;sh=d65bf9be">this</a> thread on reddit.  I found it to be well explained and pretty thorough! </p><p class="subheader">Category: <a href="http://lmontopo.github.io/category/blog.html">Blog</a>
